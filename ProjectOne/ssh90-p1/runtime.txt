I ran the command "base64 /dev/urandom  | head -c 10000000 > bar.txt" to generate a 10MB file of characters called bar.txt. Then I ran the commands "time ./p1 bar a" and "time ./p1 -s bar a" 3 times each. As a result, for without the flag, I got an average real time of 0.054 seconds, avg user time of 0.0177 seconds, and avg system time of 0.0163 seconds. For with the flag, I got an average real time of 0.0397 seconds, and average user time of 0.016 seconds, and an average sys time of 0.0137 seconds. As seen, the average times for the program with the flag are lower than the program with the flag, which means that the system calls operate slighlty faster than stdio.
