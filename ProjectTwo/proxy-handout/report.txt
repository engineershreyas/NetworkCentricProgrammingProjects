I mainly added code to the main function in proxy.c and and altered the format_log_string function. For the latter, I made it so that it added the size to the string as well. For the former, the program takes as input via command line argument, a port number. The program then opens a socket with this port number. Once the user's browser is configured to use localhost:<port_number> as the proxy, each web request that uses that HTTP (NOT HTTPS) protocol will go through this proxy. As a result, the request will be broken down into the filename, the host, and the port. Once determined that the request is legitimate, it will then forward the request to the server by doing a GET request. After a response is received, that response will be forwarded to the browser to be displayed to the user.
